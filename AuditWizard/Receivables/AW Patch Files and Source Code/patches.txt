When we need to build a new version of the software:

1. Update the BUILD version number in Visual Studio to - 8.1.x
2. DO NOT change Product Code - build Solution
3. In InstallShield open 'FinalPatch', set Latest version to new MSI (from step 1)
4. Move previous latest version msi (if any) into Previous Setups
5. Validate the build - it should tell you that it will perform a MINOR upgrade on each previous version
6. Build patch
